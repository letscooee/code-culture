# How to Commit

1. One commit must have changes for one task/feature/bug/improvement.

2. Do not commit files having changes for more than one task. For example, your single commit should have changes for 
forgot password fix only but should not have a change for adding a new email OTP feature in the forgot password feature.

3. If you are working on a new feature or task that takes you hours or days, you must do the commits frequently so 
that you can look back into the entire journey of getting that feature code ready.

4. If you are trying to make something functional that involves trying different approaches (trial-n-error), you must 
commit each attempt or each approach.

5. You must review each and every single character change before committing to make sure any unintentional change is 
not being committed.
