### Reading conventions

To enforce the code culture document within the team, it is always hard to provide the link of any specific 
guideline that's why a convention is used. For example-

- **CC3.2.1** means you have to check the `1. Naming Conventions` guideline in `3-git/2-branch-convention.md/`.
- **CC1.1.2** means you have to check the `2. Maximum line width` guideline in `1-general/README.md`.
- **CC2.1.4.4** means you have to check the 4th bullet point of `4. Code-level general verification` guideline in 
  `2-code-review/1-after-merge-request.md`.
